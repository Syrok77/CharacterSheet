<ol>
<li> Character stats

    Character stats page is a tabbed page featuring many of the important stats for a character. This should be the location of almost all relevant character stats. <br />
    The tabs are as follows, featuring these elements from the character sheet:

    <ul>
    <li> Stats: Ability Scores and Skills, Initiative, Speed, current HP, max HP, Hit Dice, TempHP, Proficiencies and languages, Inspiration
    </li>
    <li> Offense: Weapons, proficiency bonus,
    </li>
    <li> Defense: Saving throws, death saves
    </li>
    <li> Biography: Description, personality, ideals, bonds, flaws
    </li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li> Spells
</li>

<li> Equipment: Money, items, etc.
</li>
<ol>


<p>Unsolved mysteries: Features and Traits, which will probably end up in one of the character tabs because it's pretty important, but
things might be too crowded for that.
